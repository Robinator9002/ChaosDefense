A minimalistic yet captivating tower defense game, developed with Python and the Pygame library. Our core innovation is an **adaptive AI** that learns from the player's strategies, as well as procedurally generated levels with unique environmental styles.

## 🎯 Core Concept

"ChaosDefense" is a single-player tower defense game where players build defenses to protect their base from waves of enemies. The crucial difference lies in the **dynamic enemy AI**, which adapts its pathfinding and the composition of its waves based on the player's defense strategy and the outcomes of previous waves within the current game session.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🧠 Adaptive Enemy AI:** Enemies use a heuristic-based system to evaluate the effectiveness of their paths after each wave. Future waves are adjusted to exploit weaknesses.
* **🗺️ Procedural Level Generation:** Levels are programmatically generated at the start of each game and follow specific stylistic themes (e.g., "Forest," "Rocky").
* **💰 Dynamic Economy & Upgrades:** Earn resources by defeating enemies to build and upgrade towers and purchase game-wide improvements.
* **🎨 Minimalist Aesthetics:** A focus on clean, functional, and clear geometric graphics rather than high-resolution art.
* **🧱 Clean Architecture:** A strict separation between game logic (headless) and rendering (Pygame).

## 🎲 Why ChaosDefense? The Story Behind the Project

In the world of tower defense games, most waves eventually start to feel predictable. You find a "perfect" strategy and then just play it out over and over again until it gets boring. ChaosDefense was born out of skepticism about this monotony. We wanted to create a game that evolves with you. A game where your opponent isn't dumb; it learns. Every wave is a new, dynamic challenge that forces you to stay creative and constantly question your tactics. It's more than just a game—it's a continuous competition between you and the intelligent AI. Are you smart enough to beat it?

## 🤝 Join Us! We're Looking for Teammates!

ChaosDefense is a passion project, and we're firm believers that the best ideas come from collaboration. If you're passionate about Python, Pygame, AI, or just game development in general, we'd love your support! Whether you want to fix bugs, suggest new features, or just refactor some code—all help is welcome. Let's make this game something great together.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & To-do List

### ✅ Mission Accomplished: What we've already done

* **Implementation of the Adaptive Enemy AI:** The intelligent core system that analyzes and adjusts enemy paths is complete and ready to go.
* **Basic Framework for Tower AI and Targeting System:** The logical foundation for tower behavior and target acquisition has been created.
* **Functional Main Menu & User Interface:** The basic menu and navigation structure are in place.
* **Overhaul of the In-Game HUD:** The head-up display has been optimized for better clarity and usability.
* **Workshop System for Unlocking Towers:** A system to unlock new towers has been implemented.
* **Development of Level Selection:** The ability to choose between procedurally generated levels is now part of the game.
* **Progress System for Towers & Maps:** A simple system for the progress and development of towers and maps is integrated.

### ⏳ Future Missions: What's next

* **New Towers & Enemy Types:** We are working on continuously expanding the arsenal of towers and the variety of enemies.
* **Level Generation and New Themes:** New procedural level designs with unique visual themes and mechanical challenges are in the planning stages.
* **Graphical Overhaul:** The minimalist aesthetic will be supplemented with more appealing sprites, animations, and visual effects.
